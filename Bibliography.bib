Collaborative filtering is a widely used method of providing recommendations using explicit ratings on items from users. In some e-commerce environments, however, it is difficult to collect explicit feedback data; only implicit feedback is available.
					In this paper, we present a method of building an effective collaborative filtering-based recommender system for an e-commerce environment without explicit feedback data. Our method constructs pseudo rating data from the implicit feedback data. When building the pseudo rating matrix, we incorporate temporal information such as the user's purchase time and the item's launch time in order to increase recommendation accuracy.
					Based on this method, we built both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering-based recommender systems for character images (wallpaper) in a mobile e-commerce environment and conducted a variety of experiments. Empirical results show our time-incorporated recommender system is significantly more accurate than a pure collaborative filtering system.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering is a popular recommendation technique, which suggests items to users by exploiting past user-item interactions involving affinities between pairs of users or items. In spite of their huge success they suffer from a range of problems, the most fundamental being that of data sparsity. When the rating matrix is sparse, local similarity measures yield a poor neighborhood set thus affecting the recommendation quality. In such cases global similarity measures can be used to enrich the neighborhood set by considering transitive relationships among users even in the absence of any common experiences. In this work we propose a recommender system framework utilizing both local and global similarities, taking into account not only the overall sparsity in the rating data, but also sparsity at the user-item level. Several schemes are proposed, based on various sparsity measures pertaining to the active user, for the estimation of the parameter 
						Î±, that allows the variation of the importance given to the global user similarity with regards to local user similarity. Furthermore, we propose an automatic scheme for weighting the various sparsity measures, through evolutionary approach, to obtain a unified measure of sparsity (UMS). In order to take maximum possible advantage of the various sparsity measures relating to an active user, a scheme based on the UMS is suggested for estimating 
						Î±. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed estimates of 
						Î±, markedly, outperform the schemes for which

abstract = {Personalized article recommendation is important to improve user engagement on news sites. Existing work quantifies engagement primarily through click rates. We argue that quality of recommendations can be improved by incorporating different types of "post-read" engagement signals like sharing, commenting, printing and e-mailing article links. More specifically, we propose a multi-faceted ranking problem for recommending news articles where each facet corresponds to a ranking problem to maximize actions of a post-read action type. The key technical challenge is to estimate the rates of post-read action types by mitigating the impact of enormous data sparsity, we do so through several variations of factor models. To exploit correlations among post-read action types we also introduce a novel variant called locally augmented tensor (LAT) model. Through data obtained from a major news site in the US, we show that factor models significantly outperform a few baseline IR models and the LAT model significantly outperforms several other variations of factor models. Our findings show that it is possible to incorporate post-read signals that are commonly available on online news sites to improve quality of recommendations.},

In the literature, a lot of approaches for generating personalized recommendations of information items in such environment can be found. Usually, these approaches use user profiles and/or features of items to predict those relevant items, but they do not take into account the quality of these items. To overcome this problem, in this paper we propose a new recommender system based on quality. This system uses the quality of the items to estimate their relevance. The system measures the item quality and takes into account this measure like a new factor to be considered in the recommendation process. In such a way, we present a recommender system based on items' quality, to help users to access relevant research resources. This recommender systems is developed by using a fuzzy linguistic approach and it has been tested satisfactorily in a university digital library.},

abstract = {The new social media sites -- blogs, wikis, Flickr and Digg, among others -- underscore the transformation of the Web to a participatory medium in which users are actively creating, evaluating and distributing information. Digg is a social news aggregator which allows users to submit links to, vote on and discuss news stories. Each day Digg selects a handful of stories to feature on its front page. Rather than rely on the opinion of a few editors, Digg aggregates opinions of thousands of its users to decide which stories to promote to the front page. Digg users can designate other users as ``friends'' and easily track friends' activities: what new stories they submitted, commented on or read. The friends interface acts as a \emph{social filtering} system, recommending to user stories his or her friends liked or found interesting. By tracking the votes received by newly submitted stories over time, we showed that social filtering is an effective information filtering approach. Specifically, we showed that (a) users tend to like stories submitted by friends and (b) users tend to like stories their friends read and liked. As a byproduct of social filtering, social networks also play a role in promoting stories to Digg's front page, potentially leading to ``tyranny of the minority'' situation where a disproportionate number of front page stories comes from the same small group of interconnected users. Despite this, social filtering is a promising new technology that can be used to personalize and tailor information to individual users: for example, through personal front pages.},

Here we propose an adaptive model which combines similarities in users' rating patterns with epidemic-like spreading of news on an evolving network. We study the model by computer agent-based simulations, measure its performance and discuss its robustness against bias and malicious behavior. Subject to the approval fraction of news recommended, the proposed model outperforms the widely adopted recommendation of news according to their absolute or relative popularity. This model provides a general social mechanism for recommender systems and may find its applications also in other types of recommendation.},

Extensive research for recommender systems is conducted by a broad range of communities including social and computer scientists, physicists, and interdisciplinary researchers. Despite substantial theoretical and practical achievements, unification and comparison of different approaches are lacking, which impedes further advances. In this article, we review recent developments in recommender systems and discuss the major challenges. We compare and evaluate available algorithms and examine their roles in the future developments. In addition to algorithms, physical aspects are described to illustrate macroscopic behavior of recommender systems. Potential impacts and future directions are discussed. We emphasize that recommendation has great scientific depth and combines diverse research fields which makes it interesting for physicists as well as interdisciplinary researchers.},

abstract = {Recommender systems suggest a few items from many possible choices to the users by understanding their past behaviors. In these systems, the user behaviors are influenced by the hidden interests of the users. Learning to leverage the information about user interests is often critical for making better recommendations. However, existing collaborative-filtering-based recommender systems are usually focused on exploiting the information about the user's interaction with the systems; the information about latent user interests is largely underexplored. To that end, inspired by the topic models, in this paper, we propose a novel collaborative-filtering-based recommender system by user interest expansion via personalized ranking, named iExpand. The goal is to build an item-oriented model-based collaborative-filtering framework. The iExpand method introduces a three-layer, user-interests-item, representation scheme, which leads to more accurate ranking recommendation results with less computation cost and helps the understanding of the interactions among users, items, and user interests. Moreover, iExpand strategically deals with many issues that exist in traditional collaborative-filtering approaches, such as the overspecialization problem and the cold-start problem. Finally, we evaluate iExpand on three benchmark data sets, and experimental results show that iExpand can lead to better ranking performance than state-of-the-art methods with a significant margin.},
